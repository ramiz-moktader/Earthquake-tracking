# Earthquake Tracking Web Map

I was practising fetching API data with asynchronous JS and  I found a fantastic free API from USGS for tracking earthquakes worldwide. Leveraging the power of Leaflet JS, a robust mapping library, I crafted an interactive web map.

## Leaflet Legend

Working with legends in Leaflet posed some challenges, but I stumbled upon a helpful repository on GitHub: [ptma/Leaflet.Legend](https://github.com/ptma/Leaflet.Legend). This turned out to be a game-changer for integrating legends seamlessly.

## Live Map

Check out my earthquake tracking map live [here](https://ramiz-moktader.github.io/Earthquake-tracking/). It showcases date-wise earthquake data on an interactive map.

## GitHub Repository

I've uploaded the code to my GitHub repository. If you find it interesting or helpful, I'd greatly appreciate a star to this repo.
